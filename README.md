Midterm Project

Group 1

For our “Midterm Project” first we webscraped data regarding Tesla from “Seeking Alpha”; the code that was used to webscrape the data from “Seeking Alpha” can be found in the file named “webscraping.py”.
Moreover, we performed the sentiment analysis on the data we webscraped from “Seeking Alpha” and then we also downloaded data regarding Tesla from “Yahoo Finance”.
Furthermore, we studied the correlation between the data obtained from the sentiment analysis and the data regarding Tesla taken from “Yahoo Finance”.
