FE 595 Midterm Project – Group 1

For our “Midterm Project" we wanted to analyze the relationship between the sentiment of news headlines and stock returns.

First we webscraped data regarding Tesla from “Seeking Alpha”; the code that was used to webscrape the data from “Seeking Alpha” can be found in the file named “webscraping.py”.

We performed the sentiment analysis on the data we webscraped from “Seeking Alpha” and then we also downloaded data regarding Tesla from “Yahoo Finance”.

Furthermore, we studied different aspects regarding the data obtained from the sentiment analysis and the data regarding Tesla taken from “Yahoo Finance”.

With the sentimental data and TSLA returns, we created various machine learning models and calculated their accuracy.

We developed the flask app to run sentiment analysis and displat the output on the html file.
